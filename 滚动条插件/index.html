        THIS IS A SIMPLE SCROLLABLE DIV
        <h2> Package Description </h2>
        <p>Release Date: August 10, 2010</p>
        <p>The driver is the free, open-source driver issued by HP for their DeskJet and LaserJet printers. For most supported printers , this driver produces output quality equivalent to the proprietary HP drivers. In photo mode, with photo paper, the output
            quality is very high, especially for the HP DeskJet 990C and later models, which auto-detect the paper type in hardware. Photo printing is fully supported in the newer 6- and 7-ink models.</p>
        <p>A major advantage of using this driver over those supplied by HP is the direct interface between HPIJS and the native CUPS spooler, which allows printing from any printer over any available connection such as USB, AppleTalk, TCP/IP (via LPD and
            IPP), HP JetDirect, and shared windows printers via SAMBA. Additionally, this driver utilizes the existing Mac OS X USB &quot;backend&quot; and thus does not install any software that might interfere with standard USB operation.</p>
        <p>Please note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HP does not provide any support for HPLIP or HPIJS on the Mac OS X platform.</li>
            <li> Several HP USB devices may not print successfully over the standard Mac OS X USB &quot;backend&quot;. Please for more information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Release Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This release fixes a problem with the PPDs that caused many job options such as page orientation, color/grayscale mode, duplex printing, etc. to fail.</li>
            <li>HPIJS is HP's universal printer driver for most of their non-PostScript printers. It comes as a part of HPLIP, HP Linux Imaging and Printing.</li>
            <li>The PPDs for HP printers are now sourced from the HPLIP package rather than the OpenPrinting.org database.</li>
            <li>PPDs for printers from other manufacturers are provided by OpenPrinting.org.</li>
            <li>Some printers are only partially supported. Printers such as<br /> HP LaserJet 1022<br /> HP LaserJet p1505n<br /> HP LaserJet p12014<br /> HP LaserJet p2035<br /> require a proprietary plug-in for full support. This package does not contain
                or support such plug-ins.</li>
